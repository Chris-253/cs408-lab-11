# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This project connects a front-end HTML and CSS interface to an AWS backend using Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. The app allows users to add, view, and delete items from an inventory system. Styling uses natural earthy tones for a calm, organic look inspired by nature-based UI design.
